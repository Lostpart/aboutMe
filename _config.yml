  desc: "I'm a programmer skilled in Scala, Java, Python, C, and JavaScript. Student at University at Buffalo studying
  Bachelor's degree focused in Computer Science. Since 2013, my multiple personal projects and experiences have helped
  me gain valuable experience in network architecture, data structure, project maintenance and management. Now, I have
  interest in the Internet of Things(IoT), networks and artificial intelligence, but at the same time I am still
  exploring various fields of computer science. I am currently learning Theory of Computation and Programming
  Languages."   # Describe yourself.
